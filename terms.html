      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        These Terms of Service govern the use of the EdgeWizard website
        (https://edgewizard.click) and the web application (https://app.edgewizard.click).
        By creating an account or using the service, you agree to these terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Provider and scope</h2>
      <p>
        EdgeWizard is operated by:
      </p>
      <p>
        Raphael König<br />
        Austrasse 73<br />
        3176 Neuenegg<br />
        Switzerland<br />
        E-mail:
        <a href="mailto:support@edgewizard.click">support@edgewizard.click</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        These terms apply to all uses of EdgeWizard by registered and unregistered users.
        Any deviating agreements must be made in writing.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Service description</h2>
      <p>
        EdgeWizard provides an image edge detection service. Users can upload images or
        capture them via a device camera. The service processes these images and returns
        processed edge-detection results.
      </p>
      <p>
        The service is offered via a web application and may in future be extended to
        additional platforms. The concrete range of functions may change over time.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Credits and pricing</h2>
      <p>
        Use of the edge detection is based on a credit system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each processed image consumes a defined number of credits.</li>
        <li>Users can purchase credit bundles via the payment provider Stripe.</li>
        <li>Prices, bundle sizes and included credits are displayed within the app.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Paid credits are tied to the user account and are consumed when images are
        processed. Credits are not legal tender and cannot be exchanged for cash.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Free credits</h2>
      <p>
        EdgeWizard may provide free credits (for example, a daily contingency or
        introductory credits) in order to allow users to test the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount and availability of free credits can be adjusted or discontinued
        at any time. Free credits have no monetary value and cannot be refunded or
        exchanged for cash. Paid credits, where available, are used before free credits.
      </p>

      <h2>5. User accounts and security</h2>
      <p>
        Access to EdgeWizard is provided via an e-mail address and password. Users are
        responsible for keeping their login data confidential and for all activities
        carried out via their account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Password reset links are sent only to the registered e-mail address. Users are
        responsible for choosing a secure password and changing it regularly if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users may delete their account themselves at any time via the in-app account
        settings. After deletion, the account can no longer be used and remaining free
        credits expire. Paid credits that have already been consumed cannot be refunded.
      </p>
      <p>
        EdgeWizard may temporarily block or permanently close accounts if there are
        indications of misuse, fraud, or material violations of these terms.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise stated, all content, designs and branding elements connected
        with EdgeWizard are protected by copyright and may not be reproduced, edited
        or used in any other way outside the limits of copyright law without prior
        written consent.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Availability and changes to the service</h2>
      <p>
        EdgeWizard aims to provide a stable service but cannot guarantee uninterrupted
        availability. Maintenance work, updates or technical issues may temporarily
        restrict or interrupt the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scope of features, pricing, and technical implementation may be adapted
        or extended at any time, as long as this is reasonable for users.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Payments and refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Payments for credit bundles are processed exclusively via Stripe. Card and
        payment data are handled and stored only by Stripe, not on EdgeWizard servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless expressly stated otherwise, payments for consumed credits are
        non-refundable. Statutory warranty and mandatory consumer rights remain reserved.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Liability for slight negligence is excluded to the extent permitted by law.
        In particular, no liability is assumed for indirect or consequential damages
        such as loss of profit, data loss or business interruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mandatory statutory liability, for example under product liability law or
        in cases of wilful intent or gross negligence, remains unaffected.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to these terms</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service may be adapted from time to time, for example if
        EdgeWizard is further developed or if legal requirements change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current version will always be published at this location. In the event of
        material changes, users may be informed within the app or by other appropriate means.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by Swiss law, excluding its conflict of laws provisions.
        The place of jurisdiction, to the extent permitted by law, is Neuenegg, Switzerland.
        Mandatory consumer protection provisions and places of jurisdiction remain reserved.
